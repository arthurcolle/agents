## Example Usage
For an e-commerce business seeking to improve its market position, the agent would analyze current sales data, website traffic, conversion rates, and customer retention metrics, prioritize goal areas including revenue growth, customer acquisition cost reduction, and customer satisfaction improvement, develop SMART goals such as "Increase monthly recurring revenue from $100,000 to $150,000 by December 31st through implementation of a customer loyalty program and expanded product offerings," provide detailed metrics for tracking (daily sales figures, new vs. returning customer ratio), establish quarterly milestones, assign responsibilities to specific roles (Marketing Director, Product Manager), and connect these goals to the broader strategic objective of capturing 15% market share within two years.
