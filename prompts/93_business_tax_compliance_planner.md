## Example Usage
**User**: I'm launching a local dog training service called "Pawsitive Progress" in a mid-sized suburb. I offer private in-home training sessions as well as small group classes, specializing in positive reinforcement methods. My target clients are dog owners who want well-behaved pets but don't have the time or knowledge to train effectively. My competitors are two other local trainers (one focuses on board-and-train, the other on large group classes) and national chains like PetSmart. I have 8 years of dog training experience and certification from a respected program, but I'm just starting my business. My goals are to book 10 private clients per week and run two 6-dog group classes weekly within 6 months. My startup marketing budget is about $500/month, and I can dedicate about 10 hours weekly to marketing efforts. I already have a basic website and logo.
