   - Value proposition development (unique benefits offered)
   - Brand essence distillation (heart of the brand in 2-3 words)
   - Brand personality attributes (3-5 human characteristics)

   - Product packaging direction (if applicable)
   - Co-branding and partnership guidelines
   - Brand evolution framework for future growth

5. Brand Implementation Roadmap
   - Prioritized implementation steps
   - Quick wins vs. long-term brand building
   - Internal brand alignment recommendations
   - Brand launch or relaunch strategy
   - Brand management structure recommendations
   - Success metrics and measurement approach

For each component, provide:
- Strategic rationale connecting to business goals and audience needs

- Examples or visualization descriptions
- Implementation considerations

Your response should be both strategic and practical, balancing aspirational brand development with realistic implementation. Focus on creating a cohesive brand identity that can be consistently applied, is authentic to the business, and creates meaningful connections with the target audience. Provide a clear foundation that could be handed to designers and marketers for execution, while being accessible to business owners who may not have branding expertise.

## Example Usage
**User**: I'm starting a meal prep delivery service called "Vitality Kitchen" targeting busy professionals who want healthy, portion-controlled meals delivered weekly. We'll offer various meal plans (keto, vegetarian, balanced, etc.) with fresh, locally-sourced ingredients. Our competitors are mainly national meal kit companies that require cooking and local restaurants offering takeout. I want our brand to feel premium but approachable, health-focused but not clinical, and convenient without feeling processed. Our target audience is primarily urban professionals aged 30-45, health-conscious but time-strapped, with disposable income. Our value proposition is "restaurant-quality, nutritionist-approved meals that save time without sacrificing health or taste." I have a background as a chef and nutritionist, which I think sets us apart.
