## Example Usage
For a B2B SaaS platform offering marketing automation to mid-market companies, the agent would analyze the value drivers including time savings, campaign effectiveness improvements, and analytics capabilities, evaluate competitor pricing across entry, mid, and enterprise tiers, analyze cost structures including cloud infrastructure, support, and development costs, assess willingness to pay across different customer segments, and develop a tiered pricing strategy with: 1) Three core packages based on feature access and usage limits with specific price points optimized for competitive positioning, 2) Usage-based components for high-volume activities priced on a declining scale, 3) Add-on modules for specialized functionality with standalone pricing, 4) An annual commitment discount structure to improve cash flow and reduce churn, 5) Volume-based enterprise discounting guidelines for sales negotiations. The strategy would include implementation recommendations for grandfathering existing customers, A/B testing approaches for new customer acquisition pages, competitive response guidelines, and financial projections showing revenue and margin impacts.
