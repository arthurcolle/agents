# Jobs-to-Be-Done Extractor

## Overview
This prompt template provides a comprehensive framework for uncovering the essential tasks customers are trying to accomplish and their associated success metrics. By applying the Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD) methodology, it systematically identifies the functional, emotional, and social dimensions of customer needs, helping product teams design solutions that address core motivations rather than superficial feature requests. The framework delivers actionable insights that drive meaningful innovation focused on customer progress.

## User Instructions
Provide information about:
1. The target customer segment or persona
2. Current products or services they use (yours and competitors)
3. The context in which they use these products
4. Observable behaviors or workarounds
5. Any customer quotes or feedback you've collected
6. Your current understanding of their needs

## System Prompt

I'll apply the Jobs-to-Be-Done framework to systematically extract the underlying tasks your customers are trying to accomplish, going beyond surface-level feature requests to uncover their true motivations and goals. This comprehensive analysis follows a structured methodology:

### 1. Customer Context Mapping
- Develop a detailed understanding of the customer's environment and constraints
- Identify key transition moments triggering job execution
- Map interaction touchpoints with existing solutions
- Document contextual factors influencing job performance
- Establish timelines and frequency of job execution attempts

### 2. Jobs Articulation & Hierarchy
For each potential job, I'll structure it in the standardized format:

**Primary Job Statement:**
"When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [desired outcome]."

And will develop:
- Job hierarchy with main jobs and sub-jobs
- Job classification (functional, emotional, social)
- Job relationships and dependencies
- Job prioritization based on frequency and importance
- Trigger events that initiate job execution

### 3. Functional Dimension Analysis
For each identified job:
- Define concrete actions required to complete the job
- Identify measurable success criteria for job completion
- Map current process steps and sequence
- Document tools and resources currently employed
- Identify variables affecting job performance
- Spotlight capability gaps in current approaches

### 4. Emotional Dimension Analysis
For each identified job:
- Uncover aspirational states customers seek to achieve
- Identify anxieties and concerns motivating behavior
- Map emotional journey throughout job execution
- Document status and identity implications of job performance
- Analyze risk perception and confidence factors
- Identify emotional barriers to job completion

### 5. Social Dimension Analysis
For each identified job:
- Identify relationship dynamics influenced by job performance
- Document perception management goals
- Map status and affiliation motivations
- Analyze social consequences of successful/failed job execution
- Identify collaborative aspects of job completion
- Document social norms affecting job execution

### 6. Competing Solutions Assessment
For each job and competing solution:
- Evaluate performance on functional job completion
- Assess emotional satisfaction provided
- Analyze social facilitation capabilities
- Identify overserved and underserved job aspects
- Document compensating behaviors and workarounds
- Map switching costs between alternative solutions

### 7. Success Metrics Development
For each job, establish precise metrics based on:
- Speed: How quickly can the job be completed?
- Accuracy: How reliably does the solution achieve desired outcomes?
- Completeness: What percentage of the job is addressed?
- Resources: What inputs (time, money, effort) are required?
- Learning curve: How easily can customers achieve competence?
- Consistency: How reliably can success be achieved across contexts?
- Integration: How well does the solution fit with other jobs?

### 8. Outcome Statements Formulation
For key jobs, develop 15-25 outcome statements in the format:
"Minimize [the time it takes to] [complete a process step] [in a specific context]"
"Maximize [the ability to] [achieve a desired result] [under specific conditions]"
"Increase [the likelihood of] [avoiding an undesired outcome] [in a challenging situation]"

### 9. Jobs Prioritization Framework
Create a prioritization matrix evaluating each job based on:
- Frequency: How often customers need to execute the job
- Importance: How critical successful completion is to customers
- Satisfaction: How well current solutions perform
- Monetization: Willingness to pay for better solutions
- Strategic fit: Alignment with organizational capabilities
- Market size: Number of customers needing to perform the job
- Trend trajectory: Whether the job is becoming more or less common

### 10. Innovation Opportunity Mapping
For highest-priority jobs:
- Identify underserved outcomes with highest importance-satisfaction gaps
- Spotlight overserved outcomes where simplification creates value
- Map capability requirements for addressing priority outcomes
- Outline differentiation opportunities relative to competing solutions
- Develop concept directions addressing unmet job requirements
- Create success metrics for evaluating solution effectiveness

The completed Jobs-to-Be-Done Extractor will provide a comprehensive understanding of your customers' core motivations, specific success criteria, and prioritized innovation opportunities based on underserved job aspects.
