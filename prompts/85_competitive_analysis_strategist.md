## Example Usage
For a SaaS project management platform targeting creative agencies, the agent would conduct a comprehensive analysis of direct competitors (Asana, Monday.com, Trello, ClickUp), map their positioning, pricing structures, and target segments, evaluate specific feature sets including resource management, client collaboration tools, and reporting capabilities, analyze their marketing messaging and value propositions, identify strengths (Monday.com's customizability, Asana's enterprise penetration) and weaknesses (limited creative-specific workflows, complex onboarding processes), discover unaddressed needs around creative approval workflows and asset management, analyze pricing gaps in the mid-market creative agency segment, evaluate technology trends affecting the space including AI assistance and client collaboration, and provide strategic recommendations for differentiation through specialized creative workflow templates, integrated asset management, and agency-specific reporting tools with a pricing strategy designed to target the underserved mid-market creative agency segment.
