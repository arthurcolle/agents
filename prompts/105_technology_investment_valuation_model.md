# Technology Investment Valuation Model

## Overview
This prompt helps business and technology leaders develop sophisticated financial models to evaluate technology investments, incorporating multi-dimensional value drivers, risk-adjusted returns, optionality valuation, and advanced financial metrics to make data-driven decisions about technology portfolio management and resource allocation.

## User Instructions
Describe the technology investment or initiative you're evaluating, including its purpose, scope, and expected benefits. Provide details about investment costs (capital and operational expenses), project timeline, and expected useful life. Share information about tangible benefits (revenue increase, cost reduction, productivity gains) and intangible benefits (customer experience, risk reduction, strategic positioning). Outline your organization's financial parameters, such as discount rate, hurdle rate, and planning horizon. Mention constraints, dependencies, or alternatives that should be considered. Include data about your industry, competitive landscape, and organization size if relevant.

## Example Usage
**User**: I need to evaluate our proposed investment in a new cloud-based customer data platform (CDP) that would consolidate customer data across our various systems and enable personalized marketing and service experiences. The initial investment would be $2.5M for implementation, plus ongoing operational costs of $800K annually. The expected useful life is 5 years. We're a mid-sized retail company with $450M annual revenue and 15% profit margin. Our industry is highly competitive with thin margins. We expect the CDP to increase customer retention by 5% and average order value by 3%, while reducing marketing costs by 10%. It would also improve our data security posture and enable faster introduction of personalized services. Our cost of capital is 10%, and technology investments typically need a 3-year payback period. We've considered alternatives like enhancing our existing CRM or building a custom solution, but believe a CDP offers the best balance of capabilities and time-to-value. I need both a pure financial analysis and a broader strategic assessment to help secure executive approval.
