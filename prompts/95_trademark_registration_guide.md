## Example Usage
**User**: I'm launching a coffee shop called "Wild Bean Alchemist" with a logo that shows a coffee bean with small wings. We plan to start with one location in Portland, Oregon but may expand regionally in the Pacific Northwest over the next 5 years. We're just about to open our doors, so we haven't been using the name commercially yet. I did a basic Google search and didn't find any coffee shops with the same name, but that's the extent of my research. Our slogan is "Coffee Transformed." My budget is limited as we're just starting out, but I want to make sure we're protected before we invest in signage, merchandise, and marketing.

**Assistant**: # Wild Bean Alchemist Trademark Strategy

## Trademark Viability Assessment

### Distinctiveness Analysis
- **Business Name "Wild Bean Alchemist"**: Moderately strong registrability
  - "Wild Bean" is somewhat suggestive for coffee (suggestive marks receive protection)
  - "Alchemist" is arbitrary in relation to coffee (strengthens the overall mark)
  - Combined phrase creates a unique, protectable impression
  - Strength: 7/10 for registrability

- **Logo (Coffee Bean with Wings)**: Potentially registrable as a design mark
  - Combines common elements (coffee bean) with distinctive features (wings)
  - Unique combination likely registrable if rendered in a distinctive manner
  - Strength: 6/10 for registrability

- **Slogan "Coffee Transformed"**: Moderate to weak registrability
  - Somewhat descriptive of coffee preparation/service
  - May face challenges as being too descriptive without acquired distinctiveness
  - Strength: 4/10 for registrability

### Potential Registration Challenges
- **Similar Existing Marks**: Several possible conflicts requiring investigation:
  - "Wild Bean Café" (UK-based, but may have US registrations)
  - "Bean Alchemist" (possible use in specialty coffee roasting)
  - Various "Wild [food/drink]" formative marks in restaurant/café services
  - Companies using "Alchemist" in food/beverage context

## Pre-Filing Action Plan

### 1. Comprehensive Search Strategy
**Immediate Priority:**
- **Basic Search** (DIY, $0):
  - USPTO TESS database search (free): Search "wild bean," "bean alchemist," "alchemist coffee"
  - Domain registrations: Check wildbeanalchemist.com and variations
  - Social media search: Check Instagram, Facebook, Twitter for similar businesses

**Professional Search Options:**
- **Knockout Search** ($300-500):
  - Limited professional search to identify obvious conflicts
  - Recommended minimum for name and logo before investments
  
- **Comprehensive Search** ($800-1,500):
  - Full search of federal/state registrations, common law usage
  - Highly recommended before proceeding with application

### 2. Usage Documentation Protocol
- Begin immediately recording first use evidence:
  - Date-stamped photographs of signage installation
  - First customer receipts showing branding
  - Grand opening advertising materials
  - Website launch with branding
  - Save all graphic design files and revision history

### 3. Registration Approach
**Recommended Strategy:**
1. **Primary Application**: Business name "WILD BEAN ALCHEMIST" as a standard character mark
   - Provides broadest protection for the name regardless of font/styling
   - Filing Basis: Intent-to-Use (since not yet in commerce)
   - Estimated Cost: $250-350 (electronic filing fee per class)

2. **Secondary Application**: Logo as a design mark (if budget permits)
   - Protects specific visual element with coffee bean and wings
   - File after name protection is secured
   - Estimated Cost: $250-350 (electronic filing per class)

3. **Defer Slogan Protection**: "Coffee Transformed"
   - Lower distinctiveness creates registration challenges
   - Build evidence of use and consumer recognition before filing
   - Consider in future expansion phase

## Application Preparation Guidelines

### 1. Classification Strategy
**Recommended Classes:**
- **Class 43**: "Café services; Coffee shop services" (primary)
- **Class 30**: "Coffee; Coffee beans" (if you sell packaged coffee beans)
- **Class 21**: "Coffee mugs; Insulated cups" (if you sell branded merchandise)

**Budget Approach:**
- Start with Class 43 only if budget is constrained ($250-350)
- Add additional classes as business expands (each additional class = $250-350)

### 2. Goods & Services Description
**Recommended Descriptions:**
- Class 43: "Café services featuring coffee, tea, and baked goods; Coffee shop services"
- Avoid overly restrictive descriptions but be specific enough to show actual use

### 3. Specimen Preparation (for future use once operating)
- Photographs of storefront showing name/logo in use
- Menu showing the mark in connection with services
- Website screenshots showing services offered under the mark
- Marketing materials with mark connected to offerings
