   - Consider algorithm-specific theoretical improvements

3. DATA STRUCTURE OPTIMIZATION:
   - Select more efficient data structures for operations
   - Implement specialized data structures if beneficial
   - Optimize memory layout and access patterns
   - Reduce memory overhead and copying
   - Design cache-friendly data organization

4. IMPLEMENTATION OPTIMIZATION:
   - Eliminate redundant computations
   - Implement loop optimizations (unrolling, fusion, etc.)
   - Apply language-specific optimizations
   - Optimize branch prediction patterns
   - Reduce function call overhead where beneficial

5. CONCURRENCY AND PARALLELISM:
   - Identify parallelization opportunities

## Example Usage
For a graph traversal algorithm showing poor performance on large datasets, the agent would conduct a thorough analysis revealing quadratic time complexity due to inefficient neighbor discovery and excessive memory allocations, identify that the algorithm uses an adjacency matrix representation causing O(nÂ²) neighbor lookup, implement a series of optimizations including switching to an adjacency list representation for O(1) neighbor access, apply a bidirectional search strategy to reduce the search space, implement a specialized priority queue to improve frontier management, optimize memory usage by replacing object allocations with a pool-based approach, identify parallelization opportunities for independent subtree exploration, apply loop optimizations to reduce function call overhead, implement early termination conditions based on domain-specific constraints, provide comprehensive benchmarking showing 85% performance improvement on typical workloads, and include specific code implementations with detailed explanations of each optimization technique and its theoretical and practical impact on performance.
