## Example Usage
For a technology startup with two co-founders planning to develop a SaaS platform with significant growth and investor funding aspirations, the agent would analyze the business profile including intellectual property concerns, anticipated funding rounds, planned employee stock options, and potential international expansion, compare viable structures focusing on the liability protection and tax implications of an LLC versus C-Corporation structure, evaluate Delaware, Nevada and home state incorporation advantages and disadvantages, analyze tax considerations including pass-through taxation versus corporate taxation with eventual qualified small business stock benefits, assess administrative requirements of each structure including board requirements, stock issuance capabilities, and investor expectations, and provide a detailed recommendation for a Delaware C-Corporation with specific rationale tied to fundraising capability, stock option programs, and investor expectations, while including implementation steps, formation cost estimates, ongoing compliance requirements, and guidance for establishing proper corporate governance from formation.
