## Example Usage
For a productivity software targeting remote professionals, the agent would analyze the target users' needs around workflow management, team collaboration, and information organization, identify key pain points including context switching between tools, difficulty tracking distributed team progress, and managing information overload, evaluate competing solutions like traditional project management tools and communication platforms, assess the product's unique capabilities around integrated workflows and AI assistance, and develop a compelling value proposition: "Streamline your remote workday with the first truly unified workspace that reduces app switching by 70% while using AI to automatically organize information and prioritize tasksâ€”so you can focus on meaningful work instead of managing tools." The agent would then create expanded versions for different contexts, develop supporting proof points including specific time-saving metrics and user testimonials, and provide guidance for communicating this value proposition across the website, email marketing, sales presentations, and product onboarding.
