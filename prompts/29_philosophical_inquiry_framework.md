### Example: Philosophical Analysis of "What Makes an Action Morally Right?"

*[Excerpt from analysis]*

"**CONCEPTUAL CLARIFICATION:**

The question "What makes an action morally right?" contains several terms requiring careful analysis:

**"Action"** can be interpreted in multiple ways:
- Physical behaviors with observable consequences
- Decisions or choices (including omissions)
- Mental acts such as forming intentions
- Patterns of behavior over time
- Institutional or collective activities

Each interpretation shifts the focus of moral evaluation. For instance, if we consider only observable behaviors, we might develop a consequentialist framework focused on outcomes; if we include intentions, we move toward virtue or deontological frameworks.

**"Morally right"** embeds several ambiguities:
- Right as permissible (not forbidden) versus right as obligatory
- Right as meeting a minimum threshold versus right as ideal or perfect
- Right as assessed by actual versus hypothetical standards
- Right as determined by internal consistency versus external criteria
- Right as universal versus contextual or role-dependent

The question also presupposes that actions can indeed be "made" right by something—suggesting there exists some property, relation, or standard that confers moral rightness. This presupposition itself requires examination, as some philosophical perspectives (error theory, certain forms of expressivism) would challenge it.

Additionally, the phrasing "what makes" suggests a search for necessary and sufficient conditions, which assumes moral rightness has a definable essence. Alternative formulations might ask about how we recognize rightness, or why we should care about moral rightness at all.

**ARGUMENT RECONSTRUCTION:**

While the question itself is not an argument, it sits within a network of common arguments about moral rightness. Three prominent positions can be reconstructed:

**Consequentialist Position:**
P1: The effects of an action are the only morally relevant features of that action
P2: An action with better effects than alternatives is morally preferable
P3: "Morally right" means "morally preferable among available options"
C: Therefore, what makes an action morally right is that it produces better effects than available alternatives

**Deontological Position:**
P1: Moral rightness derives from conformity to moral laws or principles
P2: Moral laws/principles are binding independent of their consequences
P3: These laws/principles derive from reason (Kantian) or divine command (religious) or social contract (contractarian)
C: Therefore, what makes an action morally right is its conformity to appropriate moral laws/principles

**Virtue Ethics Position:**
P1: Actions express and reinforce character traits
P2: Virtues are character traits that enable human flourishing
P3: Actions expressing and reinforcing virtues contribute to human flourishing
P4: Contributing to human flourishing is the standard of moral rightness
C: Therefore, what makes an action morally right is that it expresses and reinforces virtuous character

Each argument structure contains embedded assumptions and raises further questions. The consequentialist position assumes effects can be meaningfully compared; the deontological position assumes universal moral principles exist; the virtue position assumes a coherent concept of flourishing.

**ASSUMPTION EXAMINATION:**

Deeper analysis reveals several fundamental assumptions underlying different approaches to this question:

**Metaphysical Assumptions:**
- Moral Realism: Most traditional approaches assume moral properties (like rightness) exist in some objective sense
- Determinism/Free Will: Attributing moral rightness typically assumes agents could have acted otherwise
- Mind-Independence: Many approaches assume moral rightness exists independent of human attitudes (though constructivist and expressivist views challenge this)

**Epistemological Assumptions:**
- Moral Knowledge: That we can recognize or know when actions are right
- Reflection/Intuition: That philosophical reflection or moral intuition provides access to moral truths
- Coherence: That our moral judgments should form a consistent, coherent system

**Anthropological Assumptions:**
- Human Nature: Different ethical traditions assume different views of human capacities, needs, and purposes
- Universality: Many approaches assume moral principles apply across cultural contexts
- Rationality: Most traditional moral theories assume humans are fundamentally rational beings

These assumptions are not universal across philosophical traditions. For instance, Buddhist ethics might question the independent self that Western moral theories often presuppose. Confucian ethics emphasizes relational roles that Western individualist ethics might minimize. Indigenous philosophical traditions often center relationships with land and non-human beings that Western anthropocentric ethics frequently overlooks.

The historical context of dominant Western conceptions of moral rightness reveals their contingency—emerging from specific traditions including Greek virtue ethics, Christian moral theology, and Enlightenment rationalism. Alternative historical trajectories might have produced very different conceptual frameworks for understanding what makes actions right.

**PERSPECTIVAL ANALYSIS:**

Examining the question through multiple philosophical lenses reveals diverse approaches:

**Analytical Tradition:**
Analytical philosophy typically approaches this question by seeking necessary and sufficient conditions for moral rightness, often employing thought experiments to test intuitions about cases. Within this tradition, G.E. Moore's open question argument challenges naturalistic definitions of "right," while R.M. Hare's prescriptivism reframes rightness in terms of universal prescriptions rather than descriptions.

From this perspective, the question becomes one of conceptual analysis: what do we mean when we call an action "right"? Is rightness a natural property, a non-natural property, or not a property at all but rather an expression of attitude or prescription?

**Continental Tradition:**
Continental approaches often reject the premise that moral rightness can be analyzed in abstract, context-independent terms. Heidegger might reframe the question in terms of authenticity and being-in-the-world; Foucault might examine how discourses of morality function as power systems; Beauvoir might emphasize how freedom and situation shape moral possibilities.

From these perspectives, the search for universal criteria of rightness might itself be questioned as reflecting a particular (Western, modern) approach to ethics that obscures its own historical and cultural situatedness.

**Non-Western Traditions:**
Confucian ethics centers appropriate behavior within hierarchical relationships (li) and emphasizes the cultivation of humaneness (ren) rather than abstract principles of rightness. The question might be reframed as: "What action expresses proper relationality in this specific context?"

Buddhist ethics focuses on actions that reduce suffering and develop compassion rather than conforming to external standards of rightness. The question becomes: "What actions lead to the cessation of suffering for all beings?"

Indigenous philosophical traditions often emphasize relations of reciprocity and responsibility within a more-than-human community. From these perspectives, the question might be: "What actions maintain right relationship with all our relations, human and non-human?"

**Feminist Philosophy:**
Feminist approaches, particularly care ethics (Gilligan, Noddings), critique traditional moral frameworks for emphasizing abstract principles over relationships and responsibilities. From this perspective, what makes an action right might be its expression of appropriate care rather than its conformity to universal principles.

Feminist philosophers have also highlighted how traditional conceptions of moral rightness often assume agents with social privilege and ignore contextual factors that constrain moral agency for marginalized groups.

**IMPLICATION EXPLORATION:**

Different answers to what makes actions right yield divergent implications:

**Theoretical Implications:**
- The answer shapes our understanding of moral disagreement—whether it represents cognitive error, cultural difference, or emotional divergence
- It determines whether moral progress is possible and how it should be understood
- It influences whether moral expertise exists and who would qualify as moral experts
- It shapes how we understand moral education and development

**Practical Implications:**
- Consequentialist frameworks tend to justify sacrificing individual interests for greater overall good
- Deontological frameworks often protect individual rights even when doing so doesn't maximize welfare
- Virtue approaches may appear less action-guiding in specific situations but provide guidance for long-term character development
- Cultural-relative approaches may promote tolerance but struggle with addressing practices that appear harmful from outside perspectives

**Meta-Ethical Implications:**
If moral rightness is:
- Objective and mind-independent: This supports moral realism and suggests moral truths exist to be discovered
- Constructed through social agreement: This suggests moral principles are human creations serving social purposes
- Merely expressive of attitudes: This suggests moral discourse doesn't describe reality but expresses and coordinates attitudes

**SYNTHETIC REFLECTION:**

The diverse perspectives on moral rightness reveal both irreconcilable differences and potential complementarities:

**Persistent Tensions:**
The tension between universal aspiration and contextual sensitivity remains unresolved—moral thinking seems to require both general principles and attention to particular circumstances. Similarly, the relationship between consequences, principles, and character appears to resist reduction to any single dimension.

**Potential Integration:**
A more comprehensive understanding might recognize that different approaches illuminate different aspects of moral experience—consequentialism capturing our concern with outcomes, deontology articulating our sense of principle, virtue ethics expressing our understanding of character, and feminist ethics highlighting the centrality of relationships.

Rather than seeking a single answer to what makes actions right, we might understand moral rightness as a complex concept with multiple dimensions—including consequences, principles, character, relationships, and context. Different moral questions might properly emphasize different dimensions.

**Unresolved Questions:**
- How do we adjudicate between competing moral frameworks when they yield contradictory judgments?
- Can we develop cross-cultural dialogue about moral rightness without imposing particular cultural assumptions?
- How should moral theories account for the ecological embeddedness of human action in the more-than-human world?
- How do power relations shape our concepts of moral rightness, and how might these concepts be decolonized?

The philosophical inquiry into what makes actions morally right ultimately reveals as much about who we are and what we value as it does about any objective moral reality. The question itself expresses a distinctly human concern with justifying our actions to ourselves and others—a concern that may be more fundamental than any particular answer to what makes actions right..."
