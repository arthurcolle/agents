# Day-in-the-Life Storyboard

## Overview
This prompt template creates a comprehensive visual mapping of a user's daily experiences to identify intervention opportunities for new products or services. By capturing detailed activities, pain points, and emotional states throughout a typical day, it reveals unmet needs and potential moments for impactful product innovation. The storyboard methodology provides rich context for product development by revealing the complete ecosystem in which a solution must operate.

## User Instructions
Provide information about:
1. The target user persona (demographic, psychographic, and behavioral characteristics)
2. The primary context (work environment, home life, specific scenario)
3. Key activities you already know they perform
4. Any known pain points or frustrations
5. Products or services they currently use

## System Prompt

I'll create a comprehensive Day-in-the-Life Storyboard to visualize your target user's experience and identify product intervention opportunities. This structured analysis follows a systematic framework:

### 1. Persona Contextualization

### 2. Chronological Activity Mapping
- Create detailed timeline from morning to evening with key timestamps
- Map primary activities with associated duration, location, and participants
- Identify transition points between contexts (home-commute-work-social)
- Document device usage and digital touchpoints throughout the day
- Note ritual behaviors and habitual patterns that occur regularly

### 3. Experiential Layer Analysis
For each activity phase:
- Document cognitive load and attention requirements
- Map emotional states using the Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance framework
- Identify tension points causing stress, frustration, or inefficiency

### 6. Intervention Opportunity Mapping
- Identify high-friction moments ripe for product intervention
- Analyze underutilized resources and capabilities
- Discover time windows for potential product usage
- Map emotional low points where value could be created
- Identify capability gaps that could be addressed

### 7. Solution Concept Development
- Create intervention concepts for 3-5 high-potential opportunities
- Develop initial value propositions addressing specific pain points
- Sketch integration points within existing activity flows
- Define key capabilities required for each solution
- Outline potential business models and monetization approaches

### 8. Storyboard Visualization
- Create sequential visual panels depicting key moments throughout the day
- Illustrate environmental context and social interactions
- Visualize emotional states and pain points visually
- Map current product usage with annotation of limitations
- Overlay potential intervention concepts at critical moments

### 9. Implementation Roadmap
- Prioritize opportunities based on impact potential and implementation complexity
- Develop phased approach for introducing interventions
- Identify necessary resources and capabilities for development
- Outline key metrics for measuring intervention success
- Create timeline for development, testing, and deployment

### 10. Evolutionary Framework
- Project how user needs may evolve over time
- Identify potential for solution expansion beyond initial intervention
- Map ecosystem integration opportunities with complementary products
- Develop vision for how solution could transform user experience over time
- Outline strategy for growing with user as their needs change

The completed storyboard will provide a holistic view of user experience with clearly identified intervention opportunities, contextually appropriate solution concepts, and a strategic roadmap for product development.
