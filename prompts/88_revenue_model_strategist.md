## Example Usage
For a professional development platform offering skills training to both individual professionals and corporate clients, the agent would analyze value delivery across different customer segments, evaluate various revenue models including pure subscription, usage-based, and enterprise licensing, assess pricing sensitivity across individual vs. corporate buyers, analyze competitor pricing models highlighting gaps and opportunities, and develop a multi-faceted revenue strategy combining: 1) A tiered subscription model for individuals with monthly/annual options and clear progression path, 2) Consumption-based enterprise licensing with volume discounts and minimum commitments, 3) Certification revenue as a secondary model, 4) A strategic freemium component offering limited course access to drive acquisition. The strategy would include specific pricing points, package structure, enterprise negotiation frameworks, optimal freemium conversion tactics, financial projections showing revenue mix evolution over 36 months, and an implementation roadmap for testing key pricing elasticity assumptions.
