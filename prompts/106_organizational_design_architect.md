## Example Usage
**User**: Our company is a B2B SaaS provider with 450 employees, offering supply chain visibility solutions. We've grown rapidly from 150 employees two years ago through organic growth and two acquisitions. Currently, we're organized in functional silos (Engineering, Product, Sales, Customer Success, etc.) with the two acquired companies still operating semi-autonomously. This is causing customer experience inconsistencies, product integration challenges, and internal confusion about decision authority. Our strategic priorities are to create a unified platform from our combined products, expand into new verticals beyond our core manufacturing base, and shift from perpetual licenses to subscription revenue. Our executive team is divided on whether to reorganize around customer segments, product lines, or maintain but improve our functional structure. We need a more scalable organization that breaks down silos while maintaining functional excellence, speeds up decision-making, and enables better cross-functional collaboration. Our culture values innovation and customer focus, but struggles with internal alignment. We compete against both legacy supply chain software providers and newer, more nimble startups.

**Assistant**: # Organizational Design Recommendation: Unified Platform B2B SaaS
