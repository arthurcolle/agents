## Example Usage
**User**: I'm the PM for an enterprise team collaboration platform that helps companies manage projects, share documents, and communicate. We're planning our next quarter and need to prioritize these features:

1. Advanced analytics dashboard
2. SSO integration with additional providers
3. Time tracking functionality
4. Mobile app notifications
5. Automated workflow builder
6. Document version history
7. Kanban board improvements
8. Whiteboarding collaboration tool
9. API enhancement for third-party integrations
10. Team calendar with resource allocation

Our main business goals are increasing enterprise adoption and reducing churn. We're seeing competitors add analytics and automation features, and customers frequently request better mobile capabilities and time tracking. Engineering resources are limited, and we want to focus on high-impact features that will help us close more enterprise deals. We measure success through user engagement, enterprise subscription growth, and customer satisfaction scores.

   - Enables customer-specific extensions

#### Quarter 3
6. **Document Version History** (Balanced value and effort)
   - Builds on document collaboration core
   - Relatively straightforward implementation
   - Addresses specific enterprise governance needs

7. **Begin Automated Workflow Builder** (Long-term strategic value)
   - Start with foundation and core use cases
   - Multi-quarter initiative due to complexity
   - High strategic importance for future differentiation

#### Future Considerations
- **Team Calendar with Resource Allocation** (Consider for Q4)
- **Kanban Board Improvements** (Quick win for future quarter)
- **Whiteboarding Collaboration Tool** (Reassess priority after core enterprise features)

## 4. Implementation & Governance

### 4.1 Data Requirements for Ongoing Prioritization

| Data Category | Sources | Collection Method |
|---------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Enterprise Impact** | - Sales team feedback<br>- Win/loss analysis<br>- Enterprise customer interviews | - Monthly sales team survey<br>- Quarterly win/loss review<br>- Bi-annual enterprise customer council |
| **Customer Feedback** | - Support tickets<br>- Feature requests<br>- Usage analytics<br>- Customer satisfaction surveys | - Monthly support ticket categorization<br>- Continuous feature request tracking<br>- Weekly usage analytics review<br>- Quarterly CSAT analysis |
| **Competitive Intelligence** | - Competitor release notes<br>- Industry analyst reports<br>- Sales competitive intelligence | - Monthly competitor tracking<br>- Quarterly analyst review<br>- Ongoing sales input collection |
| **Implementation Factors** | - Engineering estimates<br>- Technical risk assessment<br>- Architecture review | - Sprint planning sessions<br>- Technical planning meetings<br>- Monthly architecture review |

### 4.2 Prioritization Process Guidelines

**Frequency**: Quarterly prioritization with monthly check-ins

**Participants**:
- Product Management (facilitator)
- Engineering Leadership
- Sales/Customer Success representation
- Executive sponsor

**Process Steps**:
1. Gather and update data inputs for all dimensions
2. Score each potential feature independently
3. Calculate weighted scores and create initial ranking
4. Conduct cross-functional review meeting
5. Adjust for dependencies and resource constraints
6. Finalize quarterly commitments with engineering
7. Communicate decisions with transparent rationale

**Adaptation Triggers**:
- Major competitive release
- Significant shift in enterprise customer needs
- Unexpected technical challenges
- New strategic company direction

### 4.3 Decision Documentation Template

For each prioritization decision, document:

1. **Feature Summary**: Brief description and expected outcomes
2. **Scoring Breakdown**: Detailed scores with rationale for each dimension
3. **Key Decision Factors**: Most influential elements in prioritization
4. **Alternatives Considered**: Features that were deprioritized and why
5. **Dependencies & Risks**: Critical dependencies and risk factors
6. **Success Criteria**: Specific metrics to evaluate post-implementation
7. **Stakeholder Input**: Summary of key stakeholder perspectives

## 5. Recommendations & Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Validate Scoring with Stakeholders**
   - Review prioritization with engineering to confirm complexity assessments
   - Validate enterprise impact scores with sales leadership
   - Confirm customer impact ratings with customer success team

2. **Develop Detailed Requirements for Q1 Features**
   - Focus on Advanced Analytics Dashboard as top priority
   - Define MVP and phasing approach given complexity
   - Create detailed specs for Mobile Notifications and SSO Integration

3. **Establish Resource Allocation Plan**
   - Determine team assignments for Q1 priorities
   - Identify potential bottlenecks (particularly for data engineering needs)
   - Develop contingency plans for potential technical challenges

4. **Create Communication Strategy**
   - Develop internal communication explaining prioritization rationale
   - Create customer-facing roadmap (avoiding specific timelines)
   - Prepare talking points for enterprise prospects regarding analytics and workflow capabilities

### Long-Term Considerations

1. **Technical Foundation for Automation**
   - Begin architectural planning for workflow automation platform
   - Identify preparatory work needed before full development
   - Consider phased approach to deliver initial value sooner

2. **Evaluate Build vs. Buy for Whiteboarding**
   - Given high complexity and lower priority, explore partnership options
   - Assess integration approach vs. building native capability
   - Reevaluate after progress on higher-priority enterprise features

3. **Continuous Refinement Process**
   - Implement monthly prioritization check-ins to assess progress
   - Gather feedback on prioritization framework effectiveness
   - Refine scoring criteria based on learnings

This prioritization framework provides a clear, data-driven approach to maximizing enterprise impact while managing engineering resources effectively. The recommended roadmap balances immediate enterprise needs with longer-term strategic investments, focusing first on analytics capabilities that directly support enterprise adoption goals while planning for the more complex workflow automation that will drive future differentiation.
