   - Can learn and improve capabilities
   - Exposes API via FastAPI
   - Communicates via Redis PubSub
   - Implements memory and learning

3. **Agent Collective** (`agent_collective.py`)
   - Group of specialized agents with different roles
   - Collaborative problem-solving
   - Advanced consensus mechanisms
   - Role-based task delegation

4. **PubSub Service** (`pubsub_service.py`)
   - Central communication hub
   - Provides WebSocket and Redis PubSub interfaces
   - Handles message routing
   - Manages subscriptions

5. **Distributed Services** (`distributed_services.py`)
   - Service registry with health monitoring
   - Distributed task queue
   - Circuit breaker pattern
   - Fault tolerance

6. **Interface Agents**
   - CLI interface (`cli_agent.py`)
   - Web interface (`web_app.py`)

## Agent Roles and Specialization

The Agent Collective supports multiple specialized roles:

### Core System Roles
- **Coordinator**: Manages overall task flow and delegation
- **Orchestrator**: Handles complex multi-agent workflows
- **Mediator**: Resolves conflicts between agent solutions
- **Scheduler**: Optimizes task timing and dependencies
- **Resource Manager**: Manages shared resources and prevents conflicts

### Knowledge Roles
- **Researcher**: Specializes in gathering and validating information
- **Librarian**: Organizes and retrieves stored knowledge
- **Knowledge Curator**: Maintains and improves the knowledge base
- **Historian**: Tracks past decisions and outcomes
- **Forecaster**: Predicts trends and potential outcomes

### Learning Roles
- **Learner**: Focuses on acquiring new capabilities
- **Teacher**: Transfers knowledge to other agents
- **Mentor**: Guides less experienced agents

### Problem-Solving Roles
- **Planner**: Creates strategic plans for complex tasks
- **Implementer**: Executes tactical solutions
- **Tester**: Validates solutions against requirements
- **Explorer**: Searches for novel approaches to problems
- **Optimizer**: Refines existing solutions for better performance

### Specialized Domains
- **Coding Assistant**: Specializes in programming tasks
- **Data Analyst**: Specializes in data processing and statistics
- **UI Designer**: Creates user interfaces
- **Security Auditor**: Evaluates system security
- **Domain Expert**: Specializes in particular subject matter

### Current Work

- [ ] Enhanced Agent Hooks
- [ ] Improved Inter-Agent Communication
- [ ] Advanced Agent Roles
- [ ] Consensus Mechanisms
- [ ] Learning and Memory Systems

## Next Steps

### 1. Enhanced Agent Hooks

The current agent hooks provide basic lifecycle support. We should enhance them with:

- **Middleware Pattern**: Allow hooking into all agent operations
- **Performance Monitoring**: Detailed metrics collection
- **Event Filtering**: Allow subscribers to filter events by type
- **Customizable Logging**: Different log formats and destinations

### 2. Improved Inter-Agent Communication

Enhance the communication system with:

- **Structured Message Types**: Type-safe messages with validation
- **Message Routing Rules**: Smart routing based on content
- **Acknowledgment System**: Ensure delivery of important messages
- **Broadcast Capabilities**: Efficient multi-agent distribution
- **Back-pressure Handling**: Deal with message overload

### 3. Advanced Consensus Mechanisms

Implement multiple consensus protocols for different scenarios:

- **Voting-based**: Weighted and unweighted vote collection
- **Reputation-based**: Decisions influenced by past performance
- **Expert-preference**: Domain specialists get more influence
- **Learning-based**: Consensus evolves based on outcomes
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Combine multiple methods

### 4. Collective Intelligence Capabilities

Add more collective behaviors:

- **Emergent Task Detection**: Identify needs without explicit requests
- **Self-organization**: Automatic role assignment based on task
- **Knowledge Synthesis**: Combine partial knowledge for solutions
- **Adaptive Specialization**: Agents evolve toward needed roles
- **Collective Memory**: Shared experiences and lessons

### 5. Learning and Memory Systems

Enhance the learning capabilities:

- **Tiered Memory**: Different persistence levels for different data
- **Forgetting Mechanisms**: Prioritize important information
- **Transfer Learning**: Apply knowledge across domains
- **Active Learning**: Identify and pursue knowledge gaps
- **Collaborative Learning**: Share learning experiences

## Technical Architecture Details

### Middleware Patterns

```python
class AgentMiddleware:
    async def before_request(self, request):
        # Process before handling
        pass
    
    async def after_request(self, request, response):
        # Process after handling
        pass
    
    async def on_error(self, request, error):
        # Handle errors
        pass
```

### Message Structure

```python
class Message(BaseModel):
    message_id: str
    sender_id: str
    receiver_id: Optional[str]
    message_type: str
    content: Dict[str, Any]
    priority: int = 0
    timestamp: float
    ttl: Optional[int] = None
    requires_ack: bool = False
```

### Consensus Implementation

```python
class ConsensusProtocol:
    def __init__(self, agents, threshold=0.66):
        self.agents = agents
        self.threshold = threshold
        
    async def propose(self, proposal):
        # Distribute proposal
        pass
        
    async def collect_votes(self, proposal_id, timeout=30):
        # Gather responses
        pass
        
    async def reach_consensus(self, proposal):
        # Try to achieve consensus
        pass
```

## Conclusion

This multi-agent system provides a robust foundation for distributed intelligence. The next phase of development will focus on enhancing inter-agent communication, expanding collective capabilities, and improving the overall system's learning and adaptation abilities.
